# ![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=cs) SoftUni Data Structures Fundamentals with C#

## 🧾Description 
About the course:
In this course the main aspect is learning how different data structures are created and fuctionating. Implementing lists,stacks, queues, trees, DFS(Depth-First Search) and  BFS - (Breadth-First Search). Creating custom libraries with data structures. Gaining knowledge of when to use different kind of strucures via algorithm complexity analysis.

## 📚Covered topics:
- Data Structures and Complexity
